2013/08/25 - auditing of build scripts dependences - Willy Tarreau

List of dependences found in build scripts. Here are enumerated the dependences
on other scripts, system commands, external commands, and unusual files or
variables. The purpose is to help spot possible incompatibilities between some
tools or with newer build systems which might not support certain command line
arguments for some tools anymore.

The "pkg" script was not mentionned because it also calls anything based on the
build.cfg scripts which might even call autotools.
